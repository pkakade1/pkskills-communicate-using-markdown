## Welcome

GitHub is about more than code. It’s a platform for software collaboration, and Markdown is one of the most important ways developers can make their communication clear and organized in issues and pull requests. This course will walk you through creating and using headings more effectively, organizing thoughts in bulleted lists, and showing how much work you’ve completed with checklists. You can even use Markdown to add some depth to your work with the help of emoji, images, and links.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
- **What you'll learn**: Use Markdown to add lists, images, and links in a comment or text file.
- **What you'll build**: We'll update a plain text file and add Markdown formatting, and you can use this file to start your own GitHub Pages site.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with pull requests as well as edit files. If these things aren't familiar to you, we recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course, first!
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. # This is an `<THE>` header, which is the largest

## This is an `<the>` header

###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

## Step 3: Add a code example

_Great job adding an image to the file :tada:_

In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.

### Example 1

<pre>
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

### Example 2

<pre>
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

## Step 4: Make a task list

_Great job adding a code example to the file :partying_face:_

**What is a _task list_?** A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

### Example

```   
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```

#### How it looks

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

1. Return to your pull request.
1. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

   ```md
   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world
   ```


### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'communicate-using-markdown',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-communicate-using-markdown',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
