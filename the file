## Step 3: Add a code example

_Great job adding an image to the file :tada:_
     
In addition to code blocks, some code blocks should be rendered differently depending on the language, such as JavaScript or command-line text.

### Example 1

<pre>
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
### Example 2

<pre>
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
</pre>

#### How it looks

```javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```


## Step 4: Make a task list

_Great job adding a code example to the file :partying_face:_

**What is a _task list_?** A task list creates checkboxes to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests. If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.

### Example

```   
- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete
```

#### How it looks

- [x] List syntax is required
- [x] This item is complete
- [ ] This item is not complete

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a task list

GitHub Actions went ahead and made a branch for you. So you'll need to add to the file we've created in the branch, and we will check your work as you work through this course!

1. Return to your pull request.
1. Use Markdown to create a task list. Here is an example:

   ```md
   - [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Outline my portfolio
   - [ ] Introduce myself to the world
   ```
